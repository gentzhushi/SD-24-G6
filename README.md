# Bifid Cipher Algorithm

The Bifid cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher which was invented by FÃ©lix Delastelle in around 1901. The Bifid Cipher is an encryption algorithm that uses the Polybius square to encode and decode messages. This algorithm combines substitution and transposition to achieve a higher level of security.

## How Bifid Cipher Works

1. **Polybius Square**:
   - The algorithm uses a 5x5 square containing the alphabet, where the letter 'j' is typically treated as 'i' to fit all letters.
   - Each letter has specific coordinates in the square (row and column).

2. **Encoding**:
   - During encoding, the message to be encrypted is translated into coordinates from the Polybius square.
   - The letter coordinates are separated into two groups: rows and columns.
   - All row coordinates are concatenated, followed by all column coordinates.
   - Using these mixed coordinates, an encoded message is created by converting back to letters from the Polybius square.

3. **Decoding**:
   - During decoding, the encoded message is translated into a list of coordinates.
   - The coordinates are divided into two groups: the first half represents rows, and the second half represents columns.
   - The coordinates are reassembled into pairs (row and column) to reconstruct the original letters from the Polybius square.
   - This process yields the decoded message, which represents the original text.

The Bifid Cipher provides a complex yet straightforward method for encrypting and decrypting messages.
